# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A site built in the process of learning the fundamentals of front end development. 

The guide helps keep track of what I've learned so far, and is there as a reminder of some of the basics involved in each aspect of front end development.

During the prework period I've gained an understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git - the role each of these plays, and how they work together in the world of front end development.
